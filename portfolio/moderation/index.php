<p>As a first step, I started to meet my own project team mainly to interact, establish relationship and learn their perspective on the project. I learnt Product team was busy prepping to developing project stratergies, scope and assumptions. I wanted to particpate but then i had no knowledge or a strong opinion without understanding the end to end story of reviewers. </p>
<p> So I met the User researcher of our team and who was also new to the project. We discussed to begin research activity and I shared my thoughts on the research objectives and we agreed to explore and understand the end to end workflow of our moderators and listen to their story to learn their process, their painpoints and unmet needs.  </p>

<p>I was curious to learn beyond user’s perspective, I wanted to know how the system is defined and how it works from the point when and how the content gets reported till the outcome of the review. For this, i met policy team  and Engineering team to understsand the process of content lifecyle and how do reviewer's determine the content. This way, i was able to connect the dots end to end on the content atleast theoretically.</p>

                    <p>It was interesting to know how the different types of content flows and qualifies to the review queue. When a reviewer reviews user reportant content, the outcome of the decision is resulted directly on Linkedin Platform immediately and when they review Machine flagged content, the decision is used to train the data model to improve the precision of the AI Algorithm. This info encouraged me to meet data science team to collect the facts and learn about the numbers behind the review items and It truly amazed me to know the results, I felt very proud to know how Linkedin is doing their best to keep Linkedin platform safe and professional. No wonder why <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/linkedin-pinterest-instagram-top-spots-2019-digital-trust-report-facebook-stays-last?IR=T">Linkedin stands as the most trusted social plarform </a> </p>

<p> I began to analyse and categorise the research insights, the challenges, needs , painpoints and gaps in the system in alignment of the product goals. This led to narrow down on the following problem statement where we brainstromed ideas, solutions together with product, engineering leads and Ace in the session.  </p>
                      <ol>
<li>How might we simplify the manual assignment workflow?</li>
<li>How might we optimise review experience?</li>
<li>How might we reduce reviewers stress and support wellness health? </li>
<li> How might we protect and secure member data?</ol>

                        <p>Potential unintended consequences of auto-assignment </p>
                        A few of the reviewers who previously worked with auto-assignment expressed concerns about its potential negative impact: 
                        <li>Some reviewers may misuse the “assign to me” feature to place tickets they don’t want to work back into the queue.</li>
                        <li>The new feature may encourage unhealthy behaviors such as micromanagement, and excessive comparison of individual performance that can have lasting negative impact on team culture.</li>

                        I am not a fan of this model.  I've seen it in my previous company, Amazon, and it led to too many issues with micromanagement and a lot of stuff like that. … There were a lot of issues with when you can take your breaks, how many minutes you can take a break and what times you can take a break.  It just led to a whole bunch of mess later on down the line. … You have to say, I am working right now, I'm not working right now. So it wasn't you get up to go take a smoke. Then again, people who don't smoke might come up with a complaint saying that these people go for a smoke so they are taking more breaks than the other person. And I've seen all this stuff happen.

                            <p>Forcing reviewers to work only one assigned ticket at a time could be problematic.</p>
                                Reviewers currently have the flexibility to work on easy tickets before working on complex ones. Limiting reviewers to work only the assigned ticket would take away this flexibility.  <br>

                                Also, at times reviewers may seek a second opinion on a ticket.  While they wait for the second opinion, they would work on other tickets.  The new assignment system would force reviewers to either un-assign the ticket or place a temporary label on the ticket (which would require reviewers to use another workflow to retrieve and re-label the ticket).  <br>

                                Although the auto-assignment feature replaces the inefficient manual assignment workflow, it also may be taking away the flexibility reviewers currently have in terms of managing the tickets they work on.  It would be important to afford reviewers some flexibility in the new auto-assignment experience to safeguard job satisfaction. <br>

                <h5>Iteration based on feedback</h5>
                    <p>To avoid auto assignment mis-use, an opton to delibrate unassign was introduced if reviewers want to take a break or log off. The expectation here is not micro management or judged on reviewers work hours but to avoid SLA time out. However, reviewers performance will be discussed asusual with their managers end of every month on overall items and not specific to a particular instance unless if they delibrately and continuously found to misuse this option to get new items, then they can raise concerns on the behaviour </li>
                    This option allows reviewers to work offline item by not requesting for new one and on toggling off the button as an open option if they wish for it.  </p>

<p>A lot of time was spent on the labelling experience, Several sessions reviewing the concept, intent and labelling behaviour was explored. In this process, something i could influence from design and experience perspective was a critical recommendation that i requested to combine spam and lQ labels to avoid bias. This recommendation was well appreciated across various TnS folks but nearly spent more than 6 months convincing Data science, policy and Engineering team to modify the approach. </p>

<p>Reviews often require accessing multiple resources, within and outside the tool like visiting Linkedin profile and Member profile page, for context gathering and the review workflow involves many clicks, scrolls, copy & paste, and open & close of tabs, making the workflow time consuming and inefficient.

I can click on the links to make sure they're accurate. And then after that, I can just highlight the three and put that into my restriction note that has to go up to policy.

<p>Our time to delivery and cost estimation to build 40+ content types after phase 1 with 1 designer and 20 Engineer came up to 8 years of effort which was not acceptable. Either we had to triple the resource or find an alternate way to deliver solution to the ACE team else reviewers might have to switch between the two tools to do their work. </p>

<ul><li>All content other than messages content type followed alternate version of text and media component placed distinctively </li>
<li>To form context we needed to enable Linkedin iframe view to avoid reviewers to go out of the tool and this led to another challenge where reviewers could navigate to another screen using iframe concept and to return to original content they might hit refresh which has a possibility to unassign the item. so i had to came up with a fixed banner solution.  </li> </ul>

                    <h5>CHALLENGES AND LEARNING</h5>
                    <ul>
<li>There were many ad-hoc requests from stakeholders when I use to review concepts which were not planned by the product partner in the quarter. It was a challenge to get a full understanding of the actual requirements, scope and to divide time between multiple projects. I overcame this challenge by setting a clear expectation on the effort required to deliver the tasks and reprioritized the tasks by negotiating with the product and stakeholders. Also some thing i learnt is to always have buffer time planned for unexpected request </li>

<li>The scope of project Neuron was usually large with limited resources and time. It was very challenging to deliver the project in the limited time without compromising on the quality of work. I mitigated the challenge by calling out the risks in various meetings and requested for additional resources to keep the project on schedule. For this something i could do better is plan in advance when the hiring request is shared at the begining of the fiscal year. So need to plan really ahead of time </li>

<li>There was a lack of clarity on the project requirements in addition to the communication gap between the product manager and the design team. I overcame this challenge by establishing a strong relationship with the PMs by co-authoring the product documents and by helping in creating presentations. I gained trust with the PM by coordinating and discussing project challenges in multiple meetings that included reps, cross functional teams and data science to get clear understanding on the business objectives, product insights and product gaps. Also wonder what can i do better to improve trust and relationship without streching my time.</li></ul>
