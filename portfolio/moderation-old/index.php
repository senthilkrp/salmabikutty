                      <p>It is extremely important to understand the pain points of our reviewers and close the gaps in our current content moderation tools. Tooling inefficiencies will not only limit the ability of our reviewers to demonstrate their true potential but also it will lead to organizational inefficiency.</p>

<p>The below quotes from Reviewers in the UER clearly demonstrate the problems in our current moderation tools. </p>
                      <p><i>“The easiest way for me to get unassigned, unworked tickets that are getting out of SLA.  The quicker I can get access to that list and the less I have to click the better.”​</i></p>

<p><i>“Just tell me which ones need to be worked.”​</i></p>

<p><i>“Sometimes it can get overwhelming when you have 10 tabs open at the same time.”​</i></p>

<p><i>“If something happens and the reviewer is unable to continue to work on the queue, there is no way to unassign the items.” </i></p>

<p><i>“If I have to leave the office. I am sick.  Someone must work on my queue to clear it, unassign is not available.​” </i></p>

                      <p>Reviewers cannot easily connect their work to team level performance results.  Feedback on accuracy can help raise review quality, some of the quotes related to performance tracking and audit review feedback - </p>

<p><i>“You can see what they [QA] worked on. But beyond that I can’t see if I had labeled it appropriately.”​</i></p>

<p><i>“I always make sure the dashboard is as empty as I can. And whatever else in the queues, I try to get those as empty as I can.”</i></p>

Most painstaking experience in the manual assignment experience was decided to be replaced by the auto-assignment approach. Then eliminating the redundant clicks and filters used the experience and finally identifying the dependency on missing capabilities helped to clear out major concerns involved in the review process.</p>

                    <h5>Reduce the manual work for reviewers and organise the information for efficient content moderation</h5>
<p>Today, Ace reviewers use Inspector tools to review the reported content and mark suitable reasons when our members violate Linkedin policy. In order to review, Our reviewers navigate on multiple screens to review content. To elaborate, Reviewers visit the SLA dashboard, (refresh the screen for every 15-20 mins and continuously monitor to view any critical items reported by our members or Machine algo..) then they follow the cue on the  content type and severity from SLA dashboard and set up multiple filters manually within inspector tool to locate the reported item. This way reviewers end up clicking on an average of 40 times per day to self assign items. Our research insights helped us to identify that our reviewers spend a lot of time filtering and allocating the items and in some cases our reviewers work on the wrong priority order which increases risk of missing critical SLA items.</p>

The platform has insufficient translation capabilities and does not support certain file formats, forcing reviewers to action tickets based on incomplete information.  Multiple reviewers requested for the ability to return tickets to the queue when they need to step away in certain situations.</p>
                    <p>When reviewers run into foreign language content, they usually right click to copy the content, open in a new browser window or use a plugin of a third party translation tool, paste the content in the input field to translate and then return to the inspector tool to mark their decision. The procedure followed by Ace reviewer was not standard and different reviewers use different translation tools and approaches and hence lead to risk of decision consistency. Reviewers perform 5 to 6 clicks and 2 window hops on average to translate and back to review workbench.</p>

<li>“I've been working on the Workbench since a quarter now. What I've noticed as one of the initial reviewers: an improvement in the UI, and few integrations of important functionalities of inspector. The member section of the WB is surely helpful by limiting cursor travel to different tabs. The visual organisation of basic information required for a review is a huge step up from inspector. Lastly, ability to translate content within the tool is a lifesaver. Kudos to the team for that” - Jai Tripati, India</li>

                    <p><i>“Hello Salma! Just wanted to say a BIG THANKS for a job very well done. The deck was clear, concise, and easy to understand. The demo and mock ups brought the amazing progress of the team to life. More important, I've heard many times since the meeting the presentation and progress by the team referenced. We'll call that SUCCESS! Thank you all for the work that went into it!” - <b>Product Vice President</b></i></p>
 
<p><i>The Trust Council Meeting where we reviewed Neuron 1.0 truly demonstrated how amazing a job you are doing on a huge, complex and high-profile project. The thoughtful process of working closely with our TnS users has truly led to an amazing upgrade to the experience that will fundamentally change the work-lives of many of our coworkers and the impact will be evident across the ecosystem. Thank you so much for your hard work and congrats on an awesome review with the Trust Council! They were singing your praises!  <b>Design Manager</b></i></p>

<p><i>Salma joined the Neuron Crew at a crucial time where the team was figuring out on the scope of the project and translating the user research feedback to requirements, she came up to speed in less turnaround time, embraced the domain and made significant progress!!! Keep up your great work Salma!! - <b>Project Manager</b></i></p>

<p><i>“Salma has been nothing short of exceptional since the day she has joined us. Despite being the only designer for a 20+ member engineering team she has hardly said no to anything that has come her way. Her Contribution and dedication on Project Neuron has been extraordinary. She is a wonderful collaborator and has formed some amazing bonds with the folks she has worked with. I have always appreciated her for her calm demeanor and for handling all the pressure situations with great poise. A marathon project like Neuron has stayed green because of her relentless efforts and thoughtfulness to everything she has picked. One of the most key players of the Neuron team who inspires excellence to each one of us.”  <b>Engg Manager</b></i></p>

<p><i>“Cheers, Salma, Your work was critical for the success of Neuron workbench 1.0, you went above and beyond spending a lot of your time (including personal time) to meet many of our unrealistic requests during the course of the project. This helped us reach our milestones and deliver a product and a user experience that we can be proud of. Thanks again for the countless hours you spend gathering and clarifying requirements, and coming up with mocks for features that were not originally in scope. Looking forward to Workbench 2.0 :)” <b>Engg Lead</b> </i></p>

                    <ol>
                <li>There were many ad-hoc requests from stakeholders which were not planned for the quarter. It was a challenge to get a full understanding of the project requirements, scope and to divide time between multiple projects. I overcame this challenge by setting a clear expectation on the effort required to deliver the tasks and reprioritized the tasks by negotiating with the product and stakeholders.</li>
<li>The scope of project Neuron was usually large with limited resources and time. It was very challenging to deliver the project in the limited time without compromising on the quality of work. I mitigated the challenge by calling out the risks in various meetings and requested for additional resources to keep the project on schedule.</li>
<li>There was a lack of clarity on the project requirements in addition to the communication gap between the product manager and the design team. I overcame this challenge by establishing a strong relationship with the PMs by co-authoring the product documents and by helping in creating presentations. I gained trust with the PM by coordinating and discussing project challenges in multiple meetings that included reps, cross functional teams and data science to get clear understanding on the business objectives, product insights and product gaps </li>
