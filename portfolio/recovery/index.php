                      <p>
With more than half a billion members on the platform, LinkedIn has become a lucrative target for bad actors to launch and spread phishing attacks, scams, and spam. We restrict more than 100K accounts and notice 2.1K account compromise every week, which impacts our members as well as damages trust in Linkedin.</p>

<p>This project is to create a service for LI agents to revoke sessions used by bad actor on member profile in Linkedin platform to mitigate the damage to their reputation.</p>

<p>Every Account Takeover (ATO) or a Account Compromise (ACO) incident leads to a loss in the trust that the member has on our platform and also a bad member experience for the victim of the account as well as for other members who interact with the compromised account.These bad actors do a variety of damage to the member’s account. And today, Linkedin does not have an option to undo the damage done to their connections or their Linkedin profile.</p>

I reported this as Case: 1OBFUSCATED_PHONE. LinkedIn quickly secured my account but <b>indicated that there was no way to retrieve the messages that the hacker sent.</b> Ever since them that message keeps popping up when I receive notifications about birthdays, job changes, promotions, etc. So I then have to explain the hacker situation at the same time that I send the congratulations message. After all, I do want people to take my messages, and my company, seriously. I am preparing for a major new product announcement so I went looking for ways to find the hacked messages and correct the situation. I found that if I archive all more recent messages in my inbox I could eventually get back to those messages sent on Sep 18th and send a message to let my contact know what we really do. That was going well until retrieving messages stopped working. If I search for Field-Agent which is a term that the hacker used I can get back as far as Oct 2, 2019 and then the message retrieval process seems like it gets stuck”</p></blockquote></div><br><br>

<p>As the new solution will be connected to the existing process, I decided to analyze the current structure of the workflow to learn the painpoints, gaps and usability issues. I had many 1:1 interviews and group reviews with MSR agents across the globe to identify what was going well and what was not?</p>

                <p>The biggest gap involved stitching the existing and old process. On highlighting this call out, the Product team helped to resolve by introducing the new option to members on the Linkedin help and support page and that was a quick win for me :)</p>

    
                
                <p>In mean time, I learnt an enggineering limitation on revoke request confirmation cannot be immediate or have a real time approach.  To elaborate the scenatio,  when messages and comments revoke action get intiated at the same time, the request goes to 2 different team and the dependency to restore changes will be different time depending on the team resolution queue.  This means we can't confirm our member's in real time that the issue will be resolved but can take upt0 24 hours to confirm the initiated process. This led to a scenario to prioritise which content type is critical for members? So we met the Data science team and learnt the maximum damage was reported on the invitation (~65%) and messaging (~30%). Others were the (~5%) for posts and comments. </p>
                      
                <p>With the known inputs now, i created the workflow for MSR agents to support damage recovery process.</p>

                <p>The connected solution to initiate request was already in place under the legacy tool which is used by many different teams. Session viewer was part of the big old tool. This was the opportunity for this project to explore and inpire other team to transform their application to a better version.</p>

                <p>I recommended upgrading the solution in the tool by redesigning completely. This suggestion was not considered because the assumption to initiate request on the exisiting tool was quite minimal and product or the stakeholders dint want to invest resource and time for something small. I discuss on the possible scenario's that is dependent on the revoke process but i guess i wasn't able to give them a full picture on possible dependencies or may be i was'nt fully  prepared to defend  .</p>

                 
                <p>However,  i started working on the rough wireframe mostly making smaller changes in the existing solutions </p>

<ol>Major Feedback are: 
<li>List in the activity log for each session could be exhaustive, not really require the list view but the total insights will be useful </li>
<li>What will happen to the record when the session is revoked ? Engg confirmed there will be a duplicate session ID with newer insights </li>

That’s not something we need as part of good experience. Such scenario can lead to confusion for reviewers and might need to verify with date and action on the latest query</ol>

                     <p>This version, we optimised the MSR review experience to the insight full data summary over the long list of activity viewer. This gave MSR an ability to judge the profile and also confidence to communicate with member with exact count of what is revokable or which is due to policy limitations</p>

                      <p> In each review, the user scenario and related edge cases were just growing to a complicated experience. Given that we had limitation, how will we communicate to memebrs, Will the recovery be 100% successful? How will the agent know that the task is completed etc..etc.. which led to many use cases such as partial successful, error scenario, successful, inprogress etc. </p>

                    <p>Overall the requirement and scope was increased, which also means - the engg effort also increased and I got another chance to request the engg team to compare the effort on the design from scratch vs design modification. </p>

<p>Interestingly, Engineering and product agreed to build the product from scratch, because it involved the same effort and adapting to newer UI  can build the product faster using the defined Linkedin library components. </p>

<p>It was a task for me to redo all the screens but still gave me a good feeling to redesign and complete. This way, the project got the Linkedin design system and accessibility compliant</p>

                    <h5>Learnings:</h5>
                    <h6>Pressure to ship quickly:</h6>
<p>Even when they’re clear sign of bad UX in re-iterating the existing system, i continued the trajectory as there are too much emphasis on hitting the vision goal vs shipping high quality release. With a focus on speed, usuability was not a priority. This makes effort and exploration a lot harder when the date comes first.</p>

<h6>In highlight:</h6><p> We should be bold enought to pause, rethink and emphathise on the feedback that user gave us. Thought there were internal employees, ship an out comes over ship on time makes the effort and time more valuable  over training the bad UX on system. We need to balance between optimising for users outcomes over deadlines</p>


<h6>Isolate change and monitor it closely:</h6>
<p>Since the process was not fully established and the limitation to use exisiting system was complicating and challenging to define new information architecture, conceptual modal and over all user experience </p>

<p>Despite the various efforts in the doing cohorts, sequencing the changes allowed me to show the effort and user reaction on the design.  Which transformed a bigger change to re-design the structure over modifying something existing . However, some trade off was still done over the end to end experience and positively hoping that this be addressed in future projects</p>
